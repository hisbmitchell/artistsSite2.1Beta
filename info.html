        About <br><br>
        <u>Heather Mitchell</u> is a new media artist from Ottawa, Canada who is currently based in the California Bay Area.<br><br>
        
        Her work finds emotional and narrative entryways into the complex systems of computation which create our daily realities. She works primarily with sound, image, installation and performance in search of human emotion and desire reflected back to us from the worlds which have been created using binary logics and a culture of belief in scientific-objectivity.
